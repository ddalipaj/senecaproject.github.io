                <h2>Quantitative Analysis</h2>
                <h4>Process quality in cloud-related software development projects</h4>
                <hr class="star-primary">
                <p>Enterprise cloud applications are usually complex pieces of
                  software, build by loosely coupled, geographically
                  distributed, large teams of developers.  They work in many
                  different domain areas, and have to keep-up with the pressing
                  needs of a quickly-evolving industry, while at the same time
                  keeping quality and performance under control.  In this
                  environment, causal information obtained by just "keeping an
                  eye" on how the project evolves is less than enough.
                  Methodical approaches, supported by tools that deal with the
                  rich information obtained from software development
                  repositories, is needed to have a complete view of how the
                  project is behaving, evolving and performing. This work
                  package will address these needs by looking at specific
                  aspects of the problem (determining performance parameters,
                  characterizing software development systems), and providing
                  comprehensive solutions (data driven development software).
                </p>

                    <h4>Bad process smells in software development repositories </h4>
                    <p>Similar to how "code smells" help to find constructs in
                      source code that could be more error-prone, "process
                      smells" help to detect patterns in software development
                      processes that could lead to errors. To detect them,
                      information is extracted from software development
                      repositories (source code management systems, issues
                      tracking system, code review system, etc.), and analyzed
                      with statistical and other techniques. The detection of
                      these patterns can lead to take early corrective actions,
                      which are very important specially in systems with high
                      time-to- deploy constraints, such as those related to
                      cloud computing.

                    <h4>Quality assurance of software-defined cloud infrastructure </h4>
                    <p>A driving objective within the cloud computing domain is
                      the full automation of the process of deploying software
                      components onto the underlying computing infrastructure.
                      For example, the "software-defined data center" is a
                      vision where all IT infrastructure components are
                      virtualized and available as services. The deployment of
                      software systems is then a fully automated process,
                      defined in software that brings together the necessary
                      virtual infrastructure components as well as the
                      application components to provision a complete IT system.
                      New tools and languages are under active development to
                      support this vision. The aim of this research is to
                      extend quality assurance techniques available for
                      "traditional" software components to software-defined
                      infrastructure components. For example, techniques for
                      reviewing, testing, and measurement must be rethought,
                      redeveloped, and revalidated to allow assurance of
                      reliability, maintainability, security, portability, etc.
                      specifically on the software that defines cloud
                      infrastructure components and deployment processes.

                  <li>
                    <h4>Characterization of performance in key parameters of software development </h4>
                    <p>Key performance indicators are used by the industry to
                      make decisions. In the specific case of software
                      development, it is also necessary to have this type of
                      indicators to help third parties interested in investing
                      resources/participating or fostering the use of specific
                      technologies, to fully understand the risks associated to
                      that product. This is even more marked in the case of
                      open source projects, where development may be community
                      or company driven and third parties contribute to the
                      source code. Thus, the raise of specific indicators for
                      software development and more specifically in open source
                      projects, will help to facilitate the decision process
                      for stakeholders and improve the attractiveness of those
                      projects offering such information to those stakeholders.

                <h2>Quality</h2>
                <h4>Quality in cloud-related software development</h4>
                <hr class="star-primary">
                <p>With so many enterprises having an increasingly large
                  fraction of their business processes dependent on
                  cloud-related applications, the quality of these applications
                  becomes of paramount importance. Not only classical
                  approaches to quality need to be adapted to the cloud
                  development environments (such as quality assurance), but
                  also new approaches should be developed (such as the
                  detection of bad process smells, which allows for taking
                  preemptive actions). To be of practical use, these
                  quality-improving and quality-assuring techniques have to be
                  integrated in the IDEs used by cloud-related software
                  developers. These IDEs support developers in the
                  semi-automatic adoption of such techniques, and allow for the
                  integration of others that are specially needed, such as
                  intensive and systematic testing practices.

                    <h4> Improving cloud-related testing practices</h4>
                    <p>Software engineering is a team effort: Sometimes even
                      hundreds of professionals collaborate to devise, build,
                      evaluate, and modify a software system. To support
                      teamwork in software development, industry is creating
                      new integrated development environments (IDEs) in the
                      cloud, which offers a better platform for synchronous
                      development. The current state of the practice is to have
                      a sort of “Google Docs for code.” The aim of this
                      research is to investigate how to use cloud-based IDEs to
                      improve testing practices. Specifically, it will
                      qualitatively and quantitatively investigate how testing
                      is currently performed in cloud-based IDEs. Then it will
                      investigate how to reuse test run information across
                      developers, to better link tests and program components.
                      This will help, for example, to eliminate the unnecessary
                      time spent in the same tests on the same code, thus
                      reducing the time to check the quality of software
                      systems, and&mdash;consequently&mdash;the development
                      life cycle.

                    <h4>Impact of code review in cloud computing development</h4>
                    <p>Most large software development process are using code
                      review, in one way or another, to improve the quality of
                      the changed merged to the main code base.  However, it is
                      still little known how this process affects to important
                      parameters of development and deployment processes. By
                      analyzing code review repositories, and other
                      repositories with information about development and
                      deployment, it is expected to better understand how code
                      review affects to the whole development and deployment
                      process, when bottlenecks are caused, when unnecessary
                      delays are found, how expensive code review is in terms
                      of impact on different metrics, and to which extent it
                      has a positive impact in overall terms.

                    <h4>Data driven development software in cloud related software development projects</h4>
                    <p>The main goal of this line is to define a methodology to
                      help developers to obtain indicators about how the
                      software development is being undertaken. Typical methods
                      are focused on the quality of the product and its
                      evolution, but not in the community around the product
                      and how developers interact among them. This methodology
                      should specifically help open source projects to
                      understand, measure and improve their software
                      development process.  Once this process is driven by
                      metrics, those will help to avoid issues (e.g.
                      bottlenecks in the review process), to detect specific
                      deviations from the arranged issue tracking system
                      policy, or to check the health of the demographics of the
                      community among other facts. This data driven development
                      can lead to faster decision-making process especially in
                      continuous deployment contexts, such as in industries
                      related to cloud computing.

                <hr class="star-primary">
                <p>With an increasing number of applications being developed or
                  ported to cloud environments, the extension of traditional
                  practices in specific application domains to the cloud is a
                  must.  However, this extension is usually not direct, since
                  many new problems appear due to the inherently complex
                  framework in which cloud applications work. As an example,
                  engineering practices used for building software artifacts
                  cannot be readily extended to cover the configuration of
                  large and complex cloud infrastructures.  On the other hand,
                  aspects that traditional applications have been addressing
                  for a long time, such as energy efficiency or security, are
                  now appearing for their cloud counterparts.

                    <h4>Configuration management and administration of cloud computing systems </h4>
                    <p>Currently cloud computing systems are in the Cambrian
                      explosion phase programming languages and processor
                      architectures were at the dawn of computing. Tens of
                      cloud providers offer services under a variety of models,
                      with their systems requiring configuration and
                      administration in disparate ways. This is the expected
                      outcome of rapid innovation in a new era, but it has
                      costs. Systems and skills built associated with each
                      provider lack portability tying them to a specific one,
                      while the market's fragmentation increases costs and
                      undermines the ability to innovate at higher levels of
                      the infrastructure stack. The aim of the proposed
                      research is to identify the high-level portable building
                      blocks that can be used for building and managing
                      computing systems on the cloud in a way that satisfies
                      sound software engineering principles. These blocks
                      include processes, tools, and techniques for achieving
                      appropriate levels of functionality, reliability,
                      usability, efficiency, maintainability, and portability.

                    <h4>Energy-efficiency of cloud computing systems </h4>
                    <p>Energy consumption attributable to IT systems is
                      significant and increasing at an alarming rate. Decades
                      of resource-agnostic development of software systems have
                      contributed to this trend. Ongoing improvements of
                      energy-efficiency at the hardware and data center level
                      threaten to be canceled out by wasteful software. Cloud
                      computing has been identified as a development that may
                      help to curb this trend, but naive use of cloud
                      infrastructures may actually have the opposite effect,
                      for instance due to increased data traffic, insufficient
                      elasticity, or additional virtualization layers. The aim
                      of this research is to provide software engineers with
                      techniques to measure energy consumption, identify energy
                      leaks, and optimize consumption without compromising
                      competing quality attributes such as performance and
                      reliability. These techniques enable the cloud to realize
                      its energy-saving potential.

                    <h4> Secure systems on cloud computing infrastructures</h4>
                    <p>A basic tenet of IT security is that if an attacker has
                      access to the physical assets of a computing system all
                      bets are off regarding the confidentiality, integrity,
                      and availability associated with the services it
                      provides. This need not be so. It has been for decades a
                      theoretical possibility and a practical reality to
                      communicate reliably over noisy channels, and to perform
                      accurate computations with unreliable building blocks.
                      Recent theoretical advances suggest that performing
                      secure computations on insecure infrastructures is also
                      possible. The aim of this research is to develop and
                      combine theory and practice that will allow the
                      construction of secure systems on top on an inherently
                      insecure cloud computing infrastructure. On the
                      theoretical front the research will explore the limits of
                      what levels of security guarantees can be provided given
                      specific adversary capabilities, while on the practical
                      front the research will examine how these guarantees can
                      be implemented in the form of useful building blocks.
